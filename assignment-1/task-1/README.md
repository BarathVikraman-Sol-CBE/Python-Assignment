# Zen of Python 

The zen of Python was written by well-known Python developer Tim Peters.

The Zen of Python is a guide to Python design principles. It consists of 19 design principles.

This can be seen by importing this in the python interpreter.

### Beautiful is better than ugly

    This encourages python programmers to write code that is readable and beautiful to look.

### Explicit is better than implicit

    This ensures the code has a clarity to the reader.Explicit code minimizes the possibility of misunderstanding and mistakes by making its intent clear.

### Simple is better than complex

    Python's main principle is simplicity. Because simple solutions are less likely to have flaws, easier to deploy and more sturdy.

### Complex is better than complicated

    When the issue does not have a simple solution, then only the complex solution is preferable.

### Flat is better than nested

    Nested code can be challenging to read and comprehend.Python encourages flat structure which can lower the number of indentations levels and simplifies the code.

### Sparse is better than dense

    Well spaced code is preferred over dense code because of its readability.

### Readability counts

    A code is read more often than it is created, so it should be simple enough for others to comprehend.
    The usage of distinct variable names, comments and standardized formatting are motivated by this idea.

### Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules

    Even if unique situations should occur, we should not compromise the fundamental ideas of readability and code design.

### Although practicality beats purity

    The code should be written with practical standards not with pure theory.

### Errors should never pass silently

    Error management is essential. Mistakes should be recognized and corrected as they happen.

### Unless explicitly silenced

    If the error is explicitly maintained, then it is justified.

### In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess

    If we have doubt, then we should clear our doubt before proceeding to the next part of the code.

### There should be one-- and preferably only one  --obvious way  to do it

    When there are several ways to accomplish the same problem, then we should choose the most obvious and easiest approach.

### Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch

    This is a tribute to Guido van Rossum, a dutch programmer.

### Now is better than never

    It is advised to address the problems and put solutions in place as soon as possible.

### Although never is better than right now

    While making decisions quick is essential, but sometimes quick decisions can result in less than ideal results.

### If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea

    It is better to simplify the code if we are having a hard time explaining the implementation.

### If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea

    If the implementation is easy to explain, then the solution will be most likely perfect.

### Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

    This tells us that namespaces are great because they do code management and organization by reducing naming conflicts between modules/functions/classes.
    It is a major tool used by python to ensure clean and readable code.
